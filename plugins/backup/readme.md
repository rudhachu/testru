An advanced `sendFromUrl` function that can handle various types of media from URLs, including the ability to extract links from JSON data. This function will be more versatile and can be used in different scenarios. Here's the enhanced version:



This enhanced `sendFromUrl` function offers several improvements:

1. It can handle JSON endpoints by specifying a `jsonPath` in the options. This allows you to extract URLs from JSON responses.

2. It uses `axios` for fetching data, which provides better error handling and support for various content types.

3. It determines the file type using `file-type`, allowing it to handle various media types automatically.

4. It includes error handling and logging for easier debugging.

5. It's more flexible with options, allowing you to pass additional parameters to the Baileys `sendMessage` function.

Here's how you can use this function:

```javascript
// Sending a simple image
await message.sendFromUrl('https://example.com/image.jpg');

// Sending an audio file with a caption
await message.sendFromUrl('https://example.com/audio.mp3', { caption: 'Check out this song!' });

// Sending a video from a JSON endpoint
await message.sendFromUrl('https://api.example.com/data.json', { 
  jsonPath: 'data.hd',
  caption: 'High-quality video'
});
```
